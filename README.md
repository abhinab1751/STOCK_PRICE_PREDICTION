ðŸ“Š Project Update: Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning & Neural Networks ðŸ¤–

Excited to share my latest project: Stock Price Prediction Web App! ðŸš€

I've built a stock price prediction model leveraging Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Python, with a web app interface for easy access. This project is designed to forecast stock prices based on historical data and market trends, providing valuable insights for investors and traders alike.

ðŸ”‘ Key Aspects of the Project:
Machine Learning Models: Includes algorithms like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and other neural network architectures optimized for time-series forecasting.
Python-Powered: Developed with Python, utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn for efficient data processing and model training.
Web App Interface: Built a user-friendly web app (STREAMLIT) where users can input stock symbols, view predictions, and analyze performance trends in real-time.
Data-Driven Decisions: Helps investors and traders make more informed decisions based on data analysis rather than just market speculation.
ðŸŒŸ What's Next?
Improving accuracy with more complex models and additional datasets.
Expanding features like automated portfolio analysis and real-time market updates.
